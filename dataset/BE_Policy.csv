The total cost will however be significantly higher.    -A new Covid-19 tax shelter system, which is temporary, until the end of the year and is open to all SMEs that have been affected by the Covid-19 crisis.  -An increased investment deduction (25%) for investments made between 12 March and 31 December 2020.  -An increase from 50 to 100% for the deduction of costs related to organising events and catering until 31 December. --Suspension of the VAT advance for December 2020.  -An increase from 10 to 20% of the share of net income eligible for tax deductions for donations. At the same time, the tax reduction for donations to approved institutions will be increased from 45% to 60% in 2020.  -The creation of a special Corona unemployment scheme, which consists of a transition from temporary unemployment due to corona force majeure to regular economic unemployment. This 'transitional' economic unemployment can be used if the company experiences a 10% drop in turnover. Employees will attend 2 days of training per month of unemployment and will continue to receive 70% of their last capped salary.  -Companies undergoing restructuring or in difficulty will be able to reduce working time pending the resumption of their normal activities and to avoid redundancies, either by means of a collective reduction in working time, or by means of the time credit or end-of-career time credit, for which access with benefits will be lowered from 57 to 55 years of age.  -Extending access to corona parental leave. This scheme will run until 30 September with  benefits that are increased to 150% for single-parent families and families with a disabled child.  -The costs incurred by people working from home will be more easily reimbursable, up to a maximum of EUR 127 per month, with a view to achieving a better work-life balance in the future.  -make available an envelope of EUR 100 million for Public Welfare Centres (OCMW/CPAS), which will be earmarked for vulnerable people in order to extend the benefits of the social measures decided on at the previous meeting to a wider public, particularly to combat energy poverty.   -To cover the running costs related to the additional workload, Public Welfare Centres will receive an additional EUR 10 million in support.",OxCGRT

The regions (Flemish/French speaking) are now making plans in what form to restart schools in September. The approach is coordinated and similar on both language communities. The scenarios and measures are based on the actual Corona incidence in 4 ""phases"": green, yellow, orange, red. The assumption is that the new school year will start on September 1st in phase ""yellow"", meaning all schools are open and all students are taught but distancing rules apply. For Flanders: The expectation is that the year will start in ""code yellow"" which implies: -primary school: all students in school, 5 days per week, social distancing between adults and between adults and students, but no social distancing between students -secondary school: all students in school, 4 days per week, social distancing / masks in case social distancing cannot be ensured (see http://web.archive.org/web/20200716080248/https://onderwijs.vlaanderen.be/nl/coronavirus) For wallonia-brussels federation: ""On September 1, 2020, the school year will start at the Yellow level ..."" ""From September 1, compulsory education will apply fully to all children from 5 years of age. Whether or not to attend school, whether or not to follow learning will no longer be left to the discretion of parents whose children are of compulsory school age; Moreover, the organizing authorities will have the obligation to open schools and organize learning under the conditions defined in the circulars. Continuity of learning must be ensured; Finally, monitoring will be implemented to take into account the impact of the Covid on the number of students enrolled and present in certain establishments and therefore on the supervision of schools; in this regard, in nursery education, the modalities of the first counting of the year will be adapted to avoid damaging schools faced with a late return of pupils."" (see http://web.archive.org/web/20200716074148/http://www.enseignement.be/index.php?page=28294) HIGHER EDUCATION: The requirements on social distancing have led many universities to keep on-line education as the prime mode. However each university sets their own local policies that differ in their strictness. This might change as the new academic year starts on 21 September. See later entries for examples in specific universities. Due to the impact of requirements in higher eduction, the policy is set to 1T.

As a reminder, code yellow means that the virus is still present and active, but the situation is under control. This system will allow for a normal school week consisting of five days, provided certain health measures are respected, such as pupils over 12 years of age and teachers being required to wear a face mask, and the suspension of certain extracurricular activities in secondary education. In addition to this system that applies to everyone, in municipalities experiencing peaks of infected people, the Ministers of Education can decide to move to code orange. Under that colour code, certain changes are made, such as a reduced number of school days for the third through sixth years of secondary education. Parents, children and teachers will be informed by the schools. For higher education institutions, as the academic year starts later, consultations are still underway to harmonise the rules that will apply to student campuses.""

Travellers returning from orange zones will no longer be tested.  Travellers returning from red zones will have to self-quarantine from the  1st day of their return and will need to be tested on the 5th day. This obligation does not apply if people complete a self-assessment document which, after analysis, authorises them to do so. These instructions do not apply to people who spend less than 48 hours in a red zone, such as cross-border workers.  http://web.archive.org/web/20200928202006/https://www.premier.be/en/launch-risk-management-strategy-accountability-citizens",OxCGRT

Additional clarification:  Public transport users, with the exception of children up to the age of 12, are obliged to cover their mouths and noses by wearing a face mask or any other fabric alternative. This applies from the moment they enter the airport, station, at stops or on the platform, train or other means of transport organised by a public authority. If it is not possible to wear a face mask for medical reasons, a face shield can be worn. Public transport drivers are not required to cover their nose and mouth, insofar as the driver is well- isolated in a cabin on the one hand, and a poster and/or sticker indicates to users the reason why the driver is not wearing a mask on the other. This exception also applies, under the same conditions, to drivers of organised collective transport (e.g. school bus). Please consult the relevant websites for the available services of transport companies.  https://web.archive.org/web/20201123101656if_/https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/faq/#id_7",OxCGRT

262393,262393,BE,2020-12-12,E1,2.0,True,"Belgium extends financial aid to businesses affected by coronavirus measures. The Council of Ministers approved a royal decree extending to January the doubling of financial allowance for independents affected by Covid-19 measures.  In December, it covers independents in the hospitality, events, entertainment, culture, fairs, markets, travel, hairdressing and beauty sectors. The double “droit de passerelle” (transitional allowance) as the mechanism is called, grants independents without family responsibilities 2,583.40 euros per month in Covid-19 support, while those with families are eligible for 3,228.20 euros. The mechanism, which initially covered October and November, was first extended to December, and now covers the month of January, pending the implementation of a new system next year.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201215140729/https://www.brusselstimes.com/news/belgium-all-news/145101/belgium-doubles-financial-allowance-for-independents-affected-by-covid-19-measures/",OxCGRT

262931,262931,BE,2020-12-28,H7,1.0,True,"C:    On 21 December 2020, the EMA issued a positive opinion on the biontech/Pfizer vaccine and it was subsequently approved by the European Commission. On 28 December, this vaccine was administered for the first time in 3 Belgian residential care centres (located in Puurs, Brussels and Mons). From 5 January, this vaccination will be rolled out in all residential care centres. Currently, vaccines from two other companies, Moderna and Astra Zeneca/Oxford, are also undergoing the strict control of the EMA. The Moderna vaccine will be reviewed on 6 January 2021. If successful, the European Commission can give its final approval and green light for the use of this vaccine. Other potential vaccines will be examined later, including those from Johnson & Johnson or Curevac.      Will the vaccine be available to everyone from the start?  No. The vaccines will be produced continuously and quantity available will increase as they are delivered. Pending their large-scale production, several steps should be planned to best protect the most vulnerable groups and gradually increase individual immunity. (see question “Who are the priority groups?"")  At the moment, it is difficult to provide a precise schedule for the administration of these vaccines. Therefore, monitoring the progressive availability of the vaccine per priority group is crucial.    To increase the population’s immunity and to protect those most vulnerable from the virus, vaccination will take place in three phases, depending on the number of doses available.    GROUP 1a    First, the most vulnerable and exposed people will be vaccinated.    Residents and employees of residential care centres and collective care institutions: since the outbreak of the pandemic, COVID-19 has hit elderly people hard, especially those living in residential care centres. They will be vaccinated first, followed by the staff (including volunteers), followed by collective care institutions.  The medical staff from primary care and hospitals: they are in close contact with patients with Covid-19 on a daily basis. To protect them, they are vaccinated as a matter of priority.  Next, the other staff in hospitals and health services will be vaccinated, including organisations responsible for prevention activities, such as vaccination and cancer screening centres, ONE and Kind en Gezin.  In this first phase, this will require a special organisation and infrastructure (extremely low storage temperatures, multiple doses, etc.).    GROUP 1b : vulnerable people without acute medical problems but at high risk    In this phase it is expected that vaccines will become more widely available. It will then be possible to vaccinate larger groups of people. Priority will be given to people outside the hospital who are most at risk. These are the following groups:    People over 65: people over 65 are the first priority at this stage. If sufficient vaccine is available, all these people can be vaccinated at the same time. Otherwise we start with the oldest people and then work our way down.  People between 45-65 years of age with an increased risk: Then people between 45-65 years come with risk factors, such as:  Diabetes,  Hypertension, Chronic cardiovascular, pulmonary, kidney and liver disorders, haematological cancers up to 5 years after diagnosis,  All recent cancers (or recent cancer treatments)  Obesity (Body Mass Index = 30).  This list will be updated and expanded in the light of scientific developments,    Essential professions: In this phase, people with essential social and/or economic professions are vaccinated. In this second phase, we can expect fewer logistical bottlenecks and organising the vaccination will be easier for these target groups.  GROUP 2 - general population    Thirdly, vaccine doses will be available in sufficient quantities to vaccinate the rest of the population.    At this stage it can be expected that the doses can be stored and administered like other vaccines such as the flu vaccine).    https://web.archive.org/web/20210115165454/https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/vaccination/    Note: Belgium was criticised for being slow off the mark with vaccinations:  About 700 residents and staff of care homes have gotten their first shot as of January 2, when the government provided its latest update on the tally. In Germany, by contrast, roughly 317,000 doses have been administered, and about 182,000 in Italy. Yves Van Laethem, an infectious diseases specialist and spokesman for Belgium's COVID-19 crisis center, said the country is also getting fewer doses than initially promised by Pfizer — only 320,000 instead of 600,000 by late December — forcing the government to make a choice between healthcare workers and the elderly. They said they would prioritise the elderly. Hence only one group have been vaccinated in this early stage.  https://web.archive.org/web/20210107121941/https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-government-criticism-coronavirus-vaccine-campaign-frank-vandenbroucke/    Other notes:  Belgium received its first batch of 9,750 vaccines last Saturday (Dec 26, 2020) and began vaccinating  between 300 and 400 people today.     Residents and staff of care homes and health care professionals will be the first to be vaccinated. Vaccinations started in three care homes across Belgium (Woluwe-Saint-Pierre in Brussels, Mons in Wallonia and Puurs in Flanders, where the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine was produced).    Under the second phase of the plan, people over 65, patients between 45 and 65 years old at high risk from the virus due to obesity or lung disease, and people with essential jobs will get their shot. Finally, other at-risk patients and the rest of the adult population will be vaccinated.    The timing of the different phases will depend on how many doses are available at different times, and how difficult it is to store the vaccines.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210104165332/https://www.euronews.com/2020/12/28/covid-vaccine-man-96-is-first-to-receive-coronavirus-jab-in-belgium  https://web.archive.org/web/20210104165542/https://www.politico.eu/article/what-you-need-to-know-about-belgiums-vaccination-strategy/",OxCGRT

263261,263261,BE,2021-01-07,H7,1.0,True,"The government announced it is updating its Covid-19 vaccination roll-out plan which has been widely criticized for being slow. Only 700 doses were used, out of the 10,000+ vaccine doses delivered on December 28, 2020.     Professor Corinne Vandermeulen, a professor at the KU Leuven Vaccinology Department says, ""we're doing the best we can. And of course there can be critics and I know that people criticize the fact that we choose to vaccinate the people in the long term care facilities first and that we might have started with healthcare workers maybe first instead of the elderly. But the elderly, they are the most vulnerable.""    By the start of this week, only 700 of the over 10 thousand vaccine doses delivered to Belgium by an EU scheme on December 28th had been put into people's arms.    The only jab approved in the EU so far is the one from Pfizer-BioNtech.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210107181631/https://www.euronews.com/2021/01/06/belgium-to-launch-new-coronavirus-vaccine-strategy-amid-criticism-for-a-slow-roll-out",OxCGRT

Payouts will range from €5,000 to €36,000 for restaurants, up to €50,000 for hotels and up to €100,000 for nightclubs, which have now remained closed for 10 months.    https://archive.vn/JC7p4#selection-1645.0-1645.486    https://web.archive.org/web/20210121145654/https://www.brusselstimes.com/brussels-2/150607/brussels-gives-green-light-for-e74-million-in-aid-to-most-affected-sectors/",OxCGRT
