This applies to 300,000 students in Austria.  Universities can decide themselves whether to re-initiate in-person teaching under ""university autonomy."" Since May, teaching in most laboratory settings -  and other university settings where digital teaching is not possible - resumed. Hence, there is a good argument for 1G despite most university teaching being online.

They will be sent to passengers via e-mail, SMS, or can be inquired about at the counter of Austrian Airlines. •The rapid antigen test does not replace the requirement for a negative PCR test that many countries have instituted; however, it does help to make flying safer (people who test positive can’t board the train) and gives a strong indication of one’s status.

The MNS is to be fixed either with rubber bands or fabric straps. The material has to form a mechanical barrier in order to avoid the splashing of droplets when speaking, coughing and sneezing.

All citizens of school age and older who live in Austria were able to participate. People who were in Austria for work or study reasons were also allowed to participate. Minors needed to be accompanied by a legal guardian.    Persons not tested included those who had symptoms that indicated COVID-19 disease, were on sick leave due to another illness, were in official segregation in the last three months because of a SARS-CoV-2 positive test, were in quarantine, isolation or domestic isolation, have already been reserved a test for another official appointment, are regularly tested for professional reasons, and children before compulsory schooling.    As of 14 December, 22% of the population had participated – far short of the 60% the government initially said it was aiming for.     ""It's a successful step to contain the pandemic in Austria,"" Health Minister Rudolf Anschober told a press conference, adding that two million people across the country had participated in the voluntary tests out of a population of 8.8 million.

Short-time work supports companies in order to keep as many employees as possible in the company, even in times of financial crisis. The employment service (AMS) takes over the majority of the salary payments.     Short-time working cannot be requested by individual employees; this decision can only be made by the company itself. In general, support can only be given to companies that have been severely affected by the current corona crisis and have thus got into a critical financial situation.    80-90% of the salary will be covered during short-time work.    The Corona short-time work is currently limited to a duration of 3 months. This time frame can later be extended by a further 3 months.    In principle, all employees subject to unemployment insurance are eligible for short-time work, provided they have a fully paid calendar month before starting short-time work.    Members of the executive body are eligible if they are ASVG-insured; also board members who are subject to the ASVG.    Apprentices are eligible.

127490,127490,AT,2020-12-19,E2,2.0,,"No policy change    As of 19 December, loan deferral is still possible for borrowers who can no longer meet their payment obligations from consumer loans.     The statutory measures provide for a statutory right to defer payments that are to be made in the period from April 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 on the basis of a consumer credit agreement. This means that if necessary, flat-rate installments (installments including principal and interest payments), capital repayments or interest payments can be suspended (deferred) for 10 months in full.    The deferral means that the payments owed in the deferral period will be postponed to future dates. The law provides that the deferred 10 months are added to the agreed term of the loan agreement - the term of the loan is extended by 10 months. However, instead of extending the term, borrowers can also agree with the bank that the deferred installments will be made up later.     Since the right to deferment was laid down in law, banks are not allowed to charge any charges (processing fee) for the deferral.    The law also stipulates that the bank may not terminate a consumer loan - i.e. loans, overdrafts and foreign currency loans - in the period from 01/04/2020 to 01/31/2021. This means that for loans, a maturity due to missing installments, which would have been paid between 01/04/2020 and 01/31/2021, is not possible. In the case of account overdrafts, the law means that a bank can make the overdraft due for repayment on February 1, 2021 at the earliest.      https://web.archive.org/web/20201220023025/https://www.arbeiterkammer.at/beratung/konsument/Geld/Kredite/Geldsorgen_mit_Kredit_durch_Corona.html    https://web.archive.org/web/20201220023331/https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19",OxCGRT

Ultimately, this also applies to students who work as tutors, mentors, consultants or as Buddies support other students.    ""If the infection situation allows, carefully considered opening steps are planned at most universities after Easter , which allow hybrid operation with digital and analog teaching and learning formats that are held in person. This should be made possible, among other things, by the corona tests, which university and college management can provide for participation in a classroom course, a classroom test or an entrance test after Easter .

""The restrictions to combat the corona crisis were extended again on Tuesday. The coalition and the SPÖ gave approval in the main committee of the National Council. This means, for example, that until the planned opening on May 19, the catering and hotel industry will only be able to operate to a very limited extent, for example in the form of picking up food. Despite the relatively high number of cases in Vorarlberg, the state is allowed to continue on the special path it took on March 15.    ""For the time being, the nocturnal exit restrictions will remain in place until May 15: They can only be issued for ten days at a time. Health Minister Wolfgang Mückstein (Greens) had hoped to be able to lift this earlier.

Here it is the rectors' offices, course heads and other management bodies who autonomously determine what happens at their university.""    COVID guidelines define four operating modes for universities or colleges.  The four risk levels of the Ministry of Health's corona traffic light - level 1 - low risk (green), level 2 - moderate-medium risk (yellow), level 3 - high risk (orange) and level 4 - very high risk (red).  The university or college modes: presence mode (green), dual mode (yellow), hybrid mode (orange) and distance mode (red). The operating modes do not always have to correlate with the risk levels. So there can be a moderate-medium risk and a university can still opt for hybrid or distance operation.     Some in-person courses are running where it is necessary for the course to take place. For example, an Ordinance of the Rectorate on the participation in face-to-face courses and face-to-face exams at the Art University Linz was released on the 26 April stipulating requirements for proving a negative test or a recovered status to access the university buildings (including studios and workshops) and take part in face-to-face classes.

The ordinance banning aircraft from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and India has been extended to 20 June inclusive.    Other COVID-19 entry regulations  The amended entry regulation brings the 3-G rule instead of quarantine for numerous countries and is initially valid up to and including 06/30/2021.      The entry regulation provides for three categories:    1. Entry from countries with a low incidence of infection (Appendix A): 3-G rule, no quarantine  These states are summarized in Appendix A; Both EU / EEA countries and third countries with a low incidence are taken into account . Any type of entry is possible from these countries, including for tourist purposes.    A current 3-G certificate is required for entry. If this cannot be presented, a test must be performed immediately, but in any case within 24 hours. A document issued in German or English ( e.g. yellow vaccination certificate) about a vaccination that has been approved by the EMA or has successfully passed the EUL process of the WHO counts as proof of vaccination . A medical or official confirmation ( e.g.Separation notice) in German or English about an infection that has been overcome in the past six months. Proof of neutralizing antibodies is equivalent to the recovery certificate, which may not be more than 3 months old when entering the country.

Entry from risk countries (Annex B1): 3-G rule, test with quarantine  When entering from high-incidence states, a 3-G certificate must be presented. If no evidence is provided, a test must be carried out immediately, but in any case within 24 hours.    Vaccinated or recovered people do not have to enter quarantine when entering from risk countries, but those who have been tested do. This can be ended from day 5 after entry (day of entry = 0) with a new negative test result.    There is currently no country on the list of these countries .    3. Entry from virus variant states (Annex B2): PCR test and quarantine  Entry from virus variant states (Annex B2, currently United Kingdom, Brazil, India and South Africa) is only possible to a very limited extent as before. In essence, only Austrian citizens and persons with residence or habitual abode in Austria are allowed to enter. Entry for humanitarian reasons or in the urgent interest of the republic is also possible.    For people who come from a virus variant area or who have stayed in one in the past ten days, the following applies as before: Entry is only possible with a negative molecular biological test result ( e.g. PCR ). The obligation to test also applies to vaccinated and recovered people. Austrians and people residing in Austria who have been in a virus variant state in the past 10 days are allowed to enter the country, but must have one within 24 hours Imitate the PCR test. This is controlled by the health authorities.    The ordinance banning aircraft from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and India has been extended to June 20th inclusive.    The entry of other countries , which are found neither in Annex A, B1 or B2 is strictly prohibited and possible previously only in exceptional cases - such as for work or study purposes. In any case, a 3-G proof must be provided upon entry. Vaccinated or recovered people do not have to go into quarantine upon entry, but those who have been tested do. This can be ended from day 5 after entry (day of entry = 0) with a new negative test result.    The exceptions for commuters remain unchanged and still do not apply to entry from virus variant areas.    Children from 10 years of age must be tested, including the immunity level of the parents or the authorized supervisors. The quarantine obligation generally also applies to children, but does not apply if the parents or authorized supervisors are exempt from quarantine.    In principle, electronic registration using the pre-travel clearance form is currently required before each entry . This must be done 72 hours before entry at the earliest; commuters must renew it every 28 days.

COVID-19 Entry Regulation  The amended entry regulation brings the 3-G rule instead of quarantine for numerous countries and is initially valid up to and including 06/30/2021 . The entry regulation provides for three categories:    1. Entry from countries with a low incidence of infection (Appendix A): 3-G rule, no quarantine  These states are summarized in Appendix A; Both EU / EEA countries and third countries with a low incidence are taken into account . Any type of entry is possible from these countries, including for tourist purposes.    Current 3G proof is required for entry. If this cannot be presented, a test must be carried out immediately, but in any case within 24 hours. A document issued in German or English ( e.g. yellow vaccination certificate) about a vaccination that has been approved by the EMA or has successfully passed the EUL process of the WHO counts as proof of vaccination . A medical or official confirmation ( e.g.Separation notice) in German or English about an infection that has been overcome in the past six months. Proof of neutralizing antibodies is equivalent to the recovery certificate, which may not be more than 3 months old when entering the country.    The following states are currently on Annex A:  Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, France, Principality of Liechtenstein, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, New Zealand, Netherlands, Norway, Poland , Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, South Korea, Czech Republic, Hungary, Vatican, Cyprus.    2. Entry from risk countries (Annex B1): 3-G rule, test with quarantine  When entering from high-incidence states, a 3-G certificate must be presented. If no evidence is provided, a test must be carried out immediately, but in any case within 24 hours.    Vaccinated or recovered people do not have to enter quarantine when entering from risk countries, but those who have been tested do. This can be ended from day 5 after entry (day of entry = 0) with a new negative test result.    There is currently no country on the list of these countries .    3. Entry from virus variant states (Annex B2): PCR test and quarantine    Entry from virus variant states (Annex B2, currently United Kingdom, Brazil, India and South Africa) is only possible to a very limited extent as before.     Essentially, only Austrian citizens and people with residence or habitual abode in Austria are allowed to enter. Entry for humanitarian reasons or in the urgent interest of the republic is also possible.    For people who come from a virus variant area or who have stayed in one in the past ten days, the following applies as before: Entry is only possible with a negative molecular biological test result ( e.g. PCR ). The obligation to test also applies to vaccinated and recovered people. Austrians and people residing in Austria who have been in a virus variant state in the past 10 days are allowed to enter the country, but must have one within 24 hours Imitate the PCR test. This is controlled by the health authorities.    The ordinance banning aircraft from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and India has been extended to June 20th inclusive.    The entry of other countries , which are found neither in Annex A, B1 or B2 is strictly prohibited and possible previously only in exceptional cases - such as for work or study purposes. In any case, a 3-G proof must be provided upon entry. Vaccinated or recovered people do not have to go into quarantine when entering the country, but tested people do. This can be ended from day 5 after entry (day of entry = 0) with a new negative test result.    The exceptions for commuters remain unchanged and still do not apply to entry from virus variant areas.  Children from 10 years of age must be tested, including the immunity level of the parents or the authorized supervisors. The quarantine obligation generally also applies to children, but does not apply if the parents or authorized supervisors are exempt from quarantine.    In principle, electronic registration using the pre-travel clearance form is currently required before each entry . This must be done 72 hours before entry at the earliest; commuters must renew it every 28 days. The compulsory registration does not apply when entering from a country listed in Appendix A if a 3G proof can be presented upon entry.

However, if you travel without proof within the meaning of the 3-G rule, registration for pre-travel clearance and testing within 24 hours of entry is mandatory.

However, the quarantine can be ended with a negative test - but no earlier than the fifth day after entry.    When travelling for professional reasons and when travelling in the predominant interest of Austria - especially in the field of culture and sport, e.g. for supervisors and trainers - the quarantine obligation does not apply.    For entry from all other countries, proof of vaccination, a PCR, antigen or antibody test or confirmation of a survived infection must still be presented. There is also an obligation to register and quarantine. With exception of:    • regular commuters,  • cross-border school and study visits,  • Visits for family purposes,  • Visits from life partners    For fully immunized persons, the registration and quarantine obligation does not apply from the 14th day after the last necessary vaccination dose (depending on the vaccine in question).
